## Objectives
- In this tutorial, we will review and discuss the following topics/technologies and show how they are utilized in the design and development of the GameSpeed web-app:
  - Basic HTML tags
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - Glyphicons
  - Carousel
  - Servlets & JSP



## HTML:

- HTML is a markup language defining web page content.
- Content is described using HTML tags.
- Tags vary, describing elements like headings, paragraphs, images, tables, forms, etc.
- HTML files use the '.html' extension.
